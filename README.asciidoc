== Description

So far i have work done in abidos cpp, and i started a little test with
python to do abidos_py (not uploaded yet) therefore abidos cpp was been moved to
abidos_cpp and there is documentation in abidos_cpp_doc.

* You can get abidos_cpp in his new place  https://github.com/fructu/abidos_cpp
